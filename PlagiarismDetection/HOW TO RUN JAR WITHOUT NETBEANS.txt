Double click the PlagiarismDetection-x.x.jar to open the program WITHOUT console remaining on the screen.
Open "RunDebug.bat" to open the program WITH console remaining on the screen.

*NOTE: 
	Make sure to have the serviceAccountKey.json in the same folder as the jar and the .bat file.
	Make sure that if you're using RunDebug.bat, that the name of the jar is correct. Just edit it if it's not.
		So: java -jar whateverName.jar matches the jar you're trying to open.
